# crypt-env Reference

## REST API

Endpoint: `https://127.0.0.1:47821`

Authentication: Header `X-Vault-Token` containing either a session token (from POST /unlock, has TTL) or a static MCP token (stored in database, no expiry). Token verification uses constant-time comparison. Rate limiting enforced on /unlock: 5 attempts per 60-second window.

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | /unlock | none | Derives AES-GCM key from master password + Argon2 salt, generates 16-byte session token with configurable TTL |
| GET | /health | none | Returns version, status, vault_locked bool, mcp_token_configured. No longer returns item_count (removed — see Notes) |
| GET | /items | token | List items (redacted — no secret values), **scoped**: requires `environment_id`, or `project`+`environment` (case-insensitive names) query params — 422 `VALIDATION_ERROR` if unresolvable. **Discovery endpoint** — see "Global items and scope" below: accepts `include_global=true\|false\|only` (default `true`), unioning in reusable global items not linked into this environment by default. Every item carries `isGlobal` and `linked`. `type`/`category`/`search` filters apply on top of the union |
| POST | /items | token | Create item, **scoped** (same query params as GET /items). Validates: name (req, max 255), type (one of: secret/credential/link/note/command), value (req non-empty). Body accepts optional `key` (environment-var key, defaults to `name`). Accepts `?on_conflict=update\|replace\|error` (default `update`; invalid value → 422 `VALIDATION_ERROR`). On no collision: creates, owns it in the resolved project, links it under `key`, returns `201`. On a collision (an `environment_vars` row already linked to `key`): `update` re-encrypts onto the existing item **in place** if it is exclusive (non-global, linked only here, owned only by this project) and returns `200`; if the existing item is shared instead, returns `409 SHARED_ITEM_CONFLICT`. `replace` always creates a new item and repoints the link (`201`), deleting the superseded item only if it is now unreachable (unlinked and non-global) — a shared item survives, still referenced elsewhere. `error` returns `409 KEY_EXISTS` on any collision. Create-or-update-and-link is one SQLite transaction — no interleaving leaves an item owned but unlinked. Caller-supplied `isGlobal` is ignored on both `Created` and `Updated` outcomes — the response reports the value actually persisted (always `false` on this path). Encrypts with AES-GCM before storing |
| GET | /items/:id | token | Get single item metadata (redacted). **Unscoped** — reachable by id regardless of project/environment (scope is a display filter, not an access boundary; see Notes) |
| PUT | /items/:id | token | Update item. Merges — omitted fields keep existing values including secret fields. Unscoped, same as GET /items/:id |
| DELETE | /items/:id | token | Delete item. Returns 204. Unscoped |
| POST | /items/:id/reveal | token | Returns plaintext secret value. Requires `{"confirm": true}` in body. Logs access to stderr. Unscoped |
| GET | /categories | token | List categories (id, name, color, description). Unscoped — categories are global |
| POST | /categories | token | Create category. Validates name (req, max 100) and color (req). Generates random hex cid |
| PUT | /categories/:id | token | Update category fields. Passing `description: ""` clears it |
| DELETE | /categories/:id | token | Delete category. Returns 204 |
| GET | /commands | token | List items of type "command" with extracted `{{VAR}}` placeholders, **scoped** (same query params as GET /items). **Discovery endpoint** — same `include_global` contract as GET /items (default `true`); each command carries `isGlobal` and `linked` |
| GET | /commands/:id | token | Get single command with placeholders. Unscoped |
| GET | /settings | token | Get auto_lock_timeout (minutes) and hotkey. Unscoped — settings are global |
| PUT | /settings | token | Update auto_lock_timeout and/or hotkey |
| POST | /fill | token | Fill a .env template with real values, **scoped** (same query params as GET /items). Matches template keys against the resolved environment's `environment_vars.key` (not a vault-wide name search). A template key not found in scope has its **original line preserved unchanged** (not blanked) and is reported as a warning. `output_path` given: writes there via the RAII `TempEnvFile` guard, returns stats only — no secret in response. No `output_path` but `output_dir` given: the environment-name-derived filename is resolved via `fsguard::resolve_within` (issue #7) before any decryption happens — `422 PATH_NOT_CONTAINED` if it can't stay inside `output_dir`, `path` in the response is the resolved (post-canonicalization) path. Neither: returns filled content inline. Body accepts `overwrite` (default `false`) — see **Write-target gating** below |
| POST | /environments/:id/example | token | Generate a placeholder-only env file/content for the environment (`environment_id` in URL path, same convention as `/environments/:id/inject`) — `KEY=` for every linked var key, values always empty, explicitly safe to commit. Never decrypts or reads item values. Body `{output_path?, output_dir?, overwrite?}`: `output_path` writes there; `output_dir` writes to the environment-name-derived filename, contained within `output_dir` via `fsguard::resolve_within` (issue #7, same as `/fill`) — `422 PATH_NOT_CONTAINED` on escape; neither returns `{content, keys}` inline. 404 if the environment doesn't resolve. Same `overwrite` gating as `/fill` — see below |
| POST | /share/listen | token | Start LAN share session as sender, **scoped** (same query params as GET /items). Every id in `items` must already be linked into the resolved environment or the call 422s. Registers mDNS, returns `pairing_code` |
| POST | /share/connect | token | Connect as receiver using pairing_code, **scoped** (same query params as GET /items). On successful transfer, received items are owned by the resolved project and linked into the resolved environment under the sender's item names — **except** where that name collides with a key already linked in the target environment, in which case the item is still imported/owned but the existing link is left untouched and the collision is reported (see `/share/status`'s `skipped_keys`, and Notes). Returns ECDH fingerprint |
| POST | /share/confirm | token | Confirm (or reject) fingerprint. Both sides must call this |
| GET | /share/status | token | Returns session state, fingerprint, direction, received_names, skipped_keys (env-var keys NOT linked due to a collision with an existing link — see /share/connect) |
| DELETE | /share/session | token | Cancel active share session |
| POST | /share/export | token | Export items as AES-256-GCM encrypted `.vault` file. Returns passphrase in response. Unscoped (operates on item IDs directly) |
| POST | /share/import | token | Import from `.vault` file using passphrase, **scoped** (same query params as GET /items). Imported items are owned by the resolved project and linked into the resolved environment, with the same collision-skip behavior as `/share/connect`. (The Tauri GUI command for this import path still passes no scope — items land ownerless/unlinked from the GUI, same pre-existing gap as before, not addressed this pass) |
| GET | /projects | token | List all projects with their typed environments (name, template, paths, variable count) |
| POST | /projects | token | Create or update project. Returns project ID (upsert by id=0 for creation). `name` is unique case-insensitively at the DB level — creating with a name that already exists (any case) returns 409 CONFLICT instead of creating a duplicate. `name` must also pass the filesystem-hostile deny-list (issue #7: no separators, control characters, NTFS-hostile characters, reserved device names, leading/trailing dot or whitespace; 128 chars max) — 422 `VALIDATION_ERROR` otherwise |
| DELETE | /projects/:id | token | Delete project and all its environments. Returns impact summary |
| GET | /projects/:id/preview-delete | token | Show what will be deleted (impact preview) without performing the deletion |
| POST | /environments | token | Create or update environment within a project. `projectId` is now required and validated to reference an existing project — 422 if missing/invalid. `name` must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}$` (issue #7) — 422 `VALIDATION_ERROR` otherwise. Returns environment ID (upsert by id=0 for creation) |
| DELETE | /environments/:id | token | Delete a single environment. Returns 204 |
| POST | /environments/:id/inject | token | Inject environment's variables into its configured .env path(s). Takes a JSON body `{output_path?, output_dir?, overwrite?}` (previously bodyless — an empty `{}` body preserves the old behavior). `output_path`, if given, is added to (not a replacement for) the environment's configured `paths[]` — all get written. If `paths[]` is empty and no `output_path`, falls back to `{output_dir}/.env.<environment-name>`. Returns paths written, keys injected, `unmanagedPaths` (configured paths that were unmanaged and got written through anyway — see below) and `backups` (`.bak` paths created). Same `overwrite` gating as `/fill`, but only for `output_path`/`output_dir` — see below |
| POST | /relay/send | token | Encrypt selected items with Argon2id-derived key and upload to Supabase relay. Returns code + passphrase. Requires relay_supabase_url and relay_supabase_anon_key in settings |
| POST | /relay/receive | token | Download from Supabase relay, decrypt with key+passphrase, import items, **scoped** (same query params as GET /items). Imported items are owned by the resolved project and linked into the resolved environment, with the same collision-skip behavior as `/share/connect`. Burns after read (best-effort delete) |
| POST | /projects/:id/relay/send | token | Share a whole project via relay: structure (environment names, `isDefault`) plus decrypted values for the selected `environment_ids`, deduped by item across environments. Returns `{code, passphrase, project, environment_count, item_count}`. Requires relay_supabase_url and relay_supabase_anon_key in settings |
| POST | /projects/relay/receive | token | Receive a shared project from relay. Always creates a **new** project (never merges) — a case-insensitive name collision returns `409 CONFLICT`; retry with `project_name_override` in the body. Received items are owned by the new project only (`isGlobal: false`), never linked into any pre-existing project. Returns `{project, environments, item_count}`. Burns after read (best-effort delete) |
| GET | /maintenance/orphans | token | Read-only, redacted list of items with zero `environment_vars` references and `isGlobal:false` (unreachable from any list/GUI surface). No REST prune endpoint by design — a static MCP token must not be able to bulk-delete vault rows; pruning is Tauri-command-only (`vault_prune_orphan_items`), behind the GUI's confirmation, same as every other destructive vault operation |

### Examples

`curl` examples against the local server. `-k` is required — the certificate
is self-signed (see Notes below). Replace `$TOKEN` with a session token from
`/unlock` or the static MCP token from Settings.

```bash
# Unlock — returns a session token with a configurable TTL
curl -sk -X POST https://127.0.0.1:47821/unlock \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"master_password": "your-master-password"}'

# List items — scoped by environment_id
curl -sk https://127.0.0.1:47821/items?environment_id=1 \
  -H "X-Vault-Token: $TOKEN"

# List items — scoped by project + environment names (case-insensitive)
curl -sk 'https://127.0.0.1:47821/items?project=demo&environment=production' \
  -H "X-Vault-Token: $TOKEN"

# Create an item, linked into an environment as DB_HOST
curl -sk -X POST 'https://127.0.0.1:47821/items?environment_id=1' \
  -H "X-Vault-Token: $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type": "secret", "name": "DB_HOST", "value": "localhost", "key": "DB_HOST"}'

# Reveal a plaintext value — requires explicit confirm
curl -sk -X POST https://127.0.0.1:47821/items/1/reveal \
  -H "X-Vault-Token: $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"confirm": true}'

# Fill a .env template inline, scoped by project + environment
curl -sk -X POST 'https://127.0.0.1:47821/fill?project=demo&environment=production' \
  -H "X-Vault-Token: $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"template": "DB_HOST=\nPORT=3000\n"}'

# List all projects with their nested environments
curl -sk https://127.0.0.1:47821/projects -H "X-Vault-Token: $TOKEN"

# Inject an environment's variables into its configured .env path(s)
curl -sk -X POST https://127.0.0.1:47821/environments/1/inject \
  -H "X-Vault-Token: $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
```

The server is HTTPS-only on `127.0.0.1:47821` with a self-signed certificate
generated on first launch (`tls::ensure_tls_config`) — clients must either
pass `-k`/`--insecure` (as above) or trust that certificate explicitly.

**On the retired Postman collection**: `src-tauri/tests/crypt-env-api.postman_collection.json`
was deleted (tech-debt issue #11) — it asserted a `GET /health` field that no
longer exists and none of its 15 requests carried the (now mandatory)
project/environment scope, so every one of them 422'd. Nothing in CI ever
executed it, so it silently drifted out of date across a whole schema
migration. This reference section plus the `api::tests::*` suite (executed
on every push/PR — see `.github/workflows/test.yml`) are the replacement:
one documents the contract, the other proves it. A Postman collection may
return only alongside a test that replays it through the same router and
fails the build on drift — see the plan doc for the full reasoning.

### Global items and scope

**Discovery surfaces union globals; materialization surfaces never do; `linked` is the discriminator.** `GET /items` and `GET /commands` accept `include_global=true|false|only` (default `true`): `true` returns (items linked in the resolved environment) ∪ (all `isGlobal:true` items), deduplicated by id; `false` restricts to exactly what's linked — byte-for-byte what `/fill`/`/inject`/`/environments/:id/example` will materialize; `only` returns just the global set regardless of linkage (the REST equivalent of the GUI's Global Secrets screen), still requiring a valid scope. An invalid value 422s with `include_global` named in the message. Every returned item/command carries `isGlobal` (is it marked reusable) and `linked` (is it actually linked into the queried environment) so a caller can always tell "exists and reusable" apart from "will be written by fill/inject". `POST /fill`, `POST /environments/:id/inject`, `POST /environments/:id/example`, and `POST /share/listen` are unaffected by `include_global` — they resolve strictly through `environment_vars`, so linking a global into an environment remains a deliberate, explicit act.

### Notes

`decrypt_all_items` decrypts the entire vault on every authenticated request (no caching, no index), making every GET /items a full decryption pass — O(n) per request regardless of filters. Scoped endpoints add a second cost on top: `resolve_scope` loads the full project→environment→vars graph (`GET /projects`-equivalent) before the item decryption pass, so every scoped request is now O(vault) + O(project graph).

`handle_delete_item` and `handle_update_item` each acquire the vault lock twice: once to read/verify existence and once to commit changes, with full AES-GCM re-encryption of the item held between acquisitions.

Session token design uses a single `token_expires` slot (Instant monotonic), allowing only one active session per vault — concurrent client connections with different tokens will collide.

`TempEnvFile` zeros output via `std::fs::write` which passes through OS page cache; on SSDs with wear leveling, overwritten data may persist in flash cells indefinitely — acceptable for most threat models but not forensic-grade. Note this is a plain (non-atomic) write to the final destination, not a temp-file-plus-rename — a process crash mid-write can leave the target file truncated. `TempEnvFile::create_guarded` delegates the existence check, `.bak` backup and permission mode to `envfile::commit` (see **Write-target gating** below); on the error path where the guard drops without `persist()`, a path that already existed before the write is zeroed and truncated to length 0 rather than removed, so the underlying inode/permissions a caller may depend on are preserved.

**Write-target gating** (`src-tauri/src/envfile/`): every write to a caller- or owner-supplied path across `/fill`, `/environments/:id/example` and `/environments/:id/inject` goes through a shared gate before any secret is decrypted. A target that already exists and does not start with the marker line `# crypt-env: managed file (project: <name>, environment: <name>)` is classified `Foreign`. For `output_path`/`output_dir`-derived paths, a `Foreign` target is refused with `409 Conflict` (`code: "TARGET_EXISTS"`) unless the request body sets `overwrite: true`, in which case the prior contents are copied to `<path>.bak` (refusing with `409` / `code: "BACKUP_EXISTS"` if a `.bak` from an earlier overwrite is still there) before the new content is written with the marker prepended. For `/environments/:id/inject`'s owner-configured `environment.paths[]`, a `Foreign` target is never refused — written through with the same `.bak` backup, and reported once in the response's `unmanagedPaths` (it self-heals to `Managed` from then on, since the marker is now in place). Marker detection is prefix-only (first non-empty line, trimmed) — renaming the project or environment never invalidates an existing marker. Add `*.bak` to `.gitignore` in any directory these endpoints write into.

`relay_delete` after receive is best-effort (error ignored), so relay payloads remain accessible to anyone with code+passphrase until the 24-hour TTL expires if deletion fails.

CORS guard accepts `Origin: null`, correctly matching local file:// and Tauri webviews, but also matches any sandboxed iframe — minimal practical impact but violates defense-in-depth.

`PRAGMA secure_delete=ON` (issue #9): SQLite now zeroes freed page content on every `DELETE`/overwriting `UPDATE`, not just unlinking it — covers `delete_item`, `delete_project`'s cascades, the `POST /items?on_conflict=replace` superseded-item delete, and the orphan prune path uniformly. This changes on-disk behavior for *all* deletes going forward (connection-level setting, no on-disk format change, safe to remove at any time); rows deleted before this pragma was added are not retroactively scrubbed.

Projects/environments model replaces the old workspaces. A Project contains multiple typed Environments, each with its own paths and variables. Environment variables are real FK-based links (`environment_vars.item_id` → a vault item), not name-search — an item is only "in" an environment if explicitly linked via `POST /items` (with `key`), `POST /environments` (saving the var list), or one of the import paths above. Deleting a project cascades to delete all its environments via foreign key constraints.

`/projects/:id/preview-delete` returns the impact without executing the deletion — allows clients to show the user what will be removed before confirming.

**Scoping contract**: `GET /items`, `POST /items`, `GET /commands`, `POST /fill`, `POST /share/listen`, `POST /share/connect`, `POST /share/import`, `POST /relay/receive` all require project+environment scope: query params `environment_id` (i64, takes precedence if both are given) or `project`+`environment` (name strings, case-insensitive, resolved via the same lookup `POST /environments/:id/inject` has always used). Missing/unresolvable scope → 422 `VALIDATION_ERROR`.

**Scope is a filter, not an access-control boundary.** `GET/PUT/DELETE /items/:id` and `POST /items/:id/reveal` remain unscoped by design — any holder of a valid token can read/modify/reveal any item by id regardless of project. This is an acceptable model for a single-user local vault but is easy to assume otherwise given how consistently every list/create endpoint enforces scope.

`projects.name` has a case-insensitive UNIQUE index (`idx_projects_name_nocase`) — duplicate-name creation now returns 409 instead of silently succeeding. `environments.name` is only unique per-project under SQLite's default (case-sensitive) collation — two environments in the same project differing only by case (e.g. `Production`/`production`) can still coexist, and name-pair resolution (case-insensitive, picks the lowest-id match) will silently prefer one over the other with no ambiguity error. Known limitation, not fixed.

**Environment/project name validation (issue #7, fixed):** `environment.name` must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}$` (1-64 chars, starts with a letter or digit, no trailing `.` or `-`) — enforced in `project::save_environment` before the row is ever persisted, so it applies identically to `POST /environments`, the Tauri `environment_save` command, an imported `.cryptenv-proj` template, and the CLI. `project.name` gets a laxer deny-list instead (rejects separators, control characters, NTFS-hostile characters, reserved device names, leading/trailing dot or whitespace; allows spaces and non-ASCII letters; 128 chars max), enforced the same way in `project::save_project`. Rejection is `422 VALIDATION_ERROR`. Existing rows created before this validation shipped are **not** migrated or rejected at read time — they keep working (see the belt-and-braces containment below) and only get corrected the next time the row is edited. A second, independent layer (`fsguard::resolve_within`) additionally guarantees that no write derived from an environment name — validated or legacy — can land outside the caller-supplied `output_dir` on `/fill`, `/environments/:id/example`, or `project::inject_environment`'s default-filename branch; a name that somehow escapes both is a bug in this layer, not an accepted risk.

**Known, deferred issues** (found in review, not fixed in this pass): (1) `PUT /items/:id`'s "merge" behavior only applies to the `Option<T>` fields on `VaultItem` — `type` has no `#[serde(default)]`, so a client omitting it entirely gets a 422 from axum's `Json` extractor before the merge logic (or `validate_update`) ever runs; every partial update must still resend `type`. Found and pinned by `api::tests::items::update_item_partial_update_preserves_other_fields` (issue #11), not changed there since that's a behavior fix out of scope for a test-only PR. (2) `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /items/:id` and `POST /items/:id/reveal` perform no project/environment scope check — any valid token can reach any item by id. Scope is a display filter on the *list* endpoints, not an access boundary; issue #13 changes list visibility only and does not close this. Tracked separately.

`project::save_environment` → `set_environment_vars` still deletes and re-inserts an environment's whole var set on save, so removing a variable in the GUI unlinks its item without deleting it (same orphan shape `POST /items` used to produce, from a different route). Deliberately not fixed here — whether unlinking a variable should also destroy its secret is a product decision; the orphan report below is the intended surface for it. `POST /share/import`, `POST /relay/receive`, and the GUI backup-import path can also create unlinked items and are equally not orphan-cleanup targets (see the prune predicate note below).

**Orphan items** (unlinked, non-global vault rows — issue #9): every `environment_vars` key collision on `POST /items` used to leave the previously-linked item behind: still in `items`, still owned, still fully readable via `/items/:id` and `/items/:id/reveal`, just invisible to scoped listings. Fixed — see the `POST /items` row above for the new `on_conflict` semantics. `GET /maintenance/orphans` (redacted, read-only) and the Tauri commands `vault_list_orphan_items` (redacted list) / `vault_prune_orphan_items(ids)` (delete, GUI-only, typed confirmation) surface and clean up rows left behind by data written *before* this fix, or by the GUI/import routes noted above. This reference doesn't otherwise catalogue Tauri `invoke()` commands (GUI-internal, not a network-facing surface); these two are called out here because they are the only user-facing remediation for orphans and have no REST equivalent for the delete half. The underlying query (`items` with no `environment_vars` row and `isGlobal:false`) intentionally excludes global items — they retain a reachable surface via Global Secrets even when unlinked, so pruning them would delete something still visible elsewhere. There is deliberately no startup migration that prunes automatically: the same predicate matches freshly-received, not-yet-linked share/relay/backup imports, so an automatic sweep on unlock could delete something the user hasn't seen yet.

## CLI

Command: `crypt-env`

Every command that reads or writes vault items scoped to a project (`add`, `fill`, `inject`, `set`, `search`, `exec`, `list`, `cmd list/info/run`, `sync`, `share send/receive`) accepts `--project NAME` and `--env NAME` flags. Scope is resolved once per invocation via a shared helper (`commands/scope.rs::resolve`), in this order per field:

1. The command's own `--project` / `--env` flag, if given.
2. `crypt-env.json`, found by searching from the current directory upward (same convention as `.git`/`package.json` discovery) — its `project` and optional `environment` fields.
3. Fallback: project name = current working directory's folder name; environment = that project's default environment (`GET /projects`, `isDefault`). **Auto-creation on a resolution miss (`POST /projects`) only happens for `add`/`add --file`** — every other scoped command returns a clear error ("no project found for '<name>' — run `crypt-env add` to create one, or pass --project/--env") instead of silently creating server state. When `add` does create a project, it re-fetches the actual default-environment name from the server response rather than assuming a literal `"default"`, and if a concurrent invocation won the creation race (`POST /projects` → 409, name is case-insensitively unique), it re-fetches and reuses the existing project instead of erroring.

`crypt-env.json` schema (place at a project's root):

```json
{
  "project": "my-app",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

`project` is required; `environment` is optional (omit it to always fall through to the project's default environment).

| Command | Subcommand / Flags | Description |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| `add` | `KEY=value` | Add a secret from KEY=value literal, scoped to `--project`/`--env` |
| `add` | `$VARNAME` | Read value from system environment variable |
| `add` | `--file [PATH]` | Bulk-import from .env file (uses dotenvy). Defaults to `./.env`. Detects duplicates via scoped GET /items before writing |
| `add` | `--credential` | Store as credential type instead of secret |
| `add` | `--note` | Store as note type |
| `add` | `--name NAME` | Override the stored key name |
| `add` | `--force` | Skip confirmation on duplicate keys |
| `doctor` | — | Check app health, vault lock state, token files, version, and validate `crypt-env.json` if present |
| `fill` | `[PATH] [--project] [--env] [--force/-f]` | Fill a .env template with vault secrets from the resolved environment, via `POST /fill`. No PATH: looks for `.env.example` then `.env` in cwd; if neither exists, generates a fresh `.env` from the environment's own variable keys (inverse of `add`). `--force`/`-f` sends `overwrite: true` — required the first time the target already exists and wasn't created by crypt-env, otherwise the command exits non-zero with the server's 409 message on stderr. No interactive prompt (CI/pipe-safe) |
| `inject` | `NAME [--shell TYPE] [--project] [--env]` | Prints shell assignment to stdout (safe for eval). Supported: pwsh, bash, zsh, sh. Prints verify hint to stderr |
| `list` | `[--project] [--env] [--scope-globals with\|without\|only]` | List saved commands in a table, with a SCOPE column (`linked`/`global`/`global+linked`). `--scope-globals` (default `with`) controls whether unlinked global commands are included |
| `exec` | `NAME [ARGS] [--project] [--env]` | Execute a saved command by name |
| `memory` | — | Save a command string interactively |
| `search` | `QUERY [--project] [--env] [--scope-globals with\|without\|only]` | Search items by name/title within scope. Prints table of ID, TYPE, NAME, SCOPE (`linked`/`global`/`global+linked`), CATEGORIES. `--scope-globals` (default `with`) controls whether unlinked global items are included. No values shown |
| `set` | `NAME [--project] [--env]` | Print export/env assignment for a secret (stdout) |
| `cmd` | `list/info/run [--project] [--env]` | Manage saved commands (list, get info, run) |
| `share send` | `ITEM_IDS... [--project] [--env]` | Start LAN share as sender. Items must already be linked into the resolved environment. Polls for peer, shows fingerprint, prompts confirmation |
| `share receive` | `[--project] [--env]` | Connect as receiver. Received items are owned by `--project` and linked into `--env`, except where the sender's item name collides with a key already linked there — that item is still imported but the existing link is left alone, and the collision is warned about (`skipped_keys`). Prompts pairing code, shows fingerprint, prompts confirmation |
| `share export` | `ITEM_IDS -o OUTPUT` | Export items as encrypted .vault file. Displays passphrase once. Unscoped (operates on item IDs directly) |
| `share import` | `-f FILE [--project] [--env]` | Import from .vault file. Prompts passphrase via rpassword (no echo). Scoped — imported items are owned by `--project` and linked into `--env`, same collision-skip behavior as `share receive` |
| `category list` | — | List all categories (unscoped, global) |
| `category create` | `NAME COLOR [DESC]` | Create a new category (unscoped, global) |
| `category edit` | `ID [fields]` | Edit category by ID (unscoped, global) |
| `category delete` | `ID` | Delete category by ID (unscoped, global) |
| `tui` | `[--project] [--env]` | Launch interactive TUI, scoped to the resolved project/environment |
| `project list` | — | List all projects with their typed environments (name, template, paths, var count) |
| `project inject` | `--id ID` or `--project NAME --environment NAME` | Inject an environment's vars into its configured .env path(s) |
| `project delete` | `--id ID` | Delete a project and all its environments |
| `project delete-env` | `--id ID` | Delete a single environment by ID |
| `relay send` | `--items 1,2,3` | Send items via internet relay. Prints code + passphrase once. Unscoped |
| `relay receive` | `--code CODE --passphrase PASS [--project] [--env]` | Receive items via relay. Scoped — imported items are owned by `--project` and linked into `--env`, same collision-skip behavior as `share receive` |
| `sync` | `[--example PATH] [--env PATH] [--dry-run] [--project] [--environment]` | Add new variables from .env.example into .env without overwriting existing. Fills from the resolved project/environment's vault items when found. (Note: `--env` here means the target `.env` file path, pre-existing flag name — the environment-name flag is `--environment` to avoid the clash) |

### Notes

`add --file` loads the scoped item list via GET /items to detect duplicates, then POSTs each item sequentially — N+1 HTTP requests for a large .env file, with no batch-create optimization.

`share send` polls GET /share/status with `sleep(1s)` in a loop for up to 300 iterations (5 min) for fingerprint, then another 600 iterations (10 min) for peer acceptance — blocking the terminal indefinitely if the peer crashes or never connects.

`relay receive` accepts `--passphrase` as a CLI argument, which appears in shell history and `ps` output; all other secrets use `rpassword` (hidden prompt) — relay breaks this pattern.

`inject` prints the value to stdout embedded in a shell assignment; on multi-user systems the value is momentarily visible in `/proc/self/fd/1` on Linux and similar process introspection on other OSes.

`sync` appends new lines via `std::fs::OpenOptions::append` — if the .env file lacks a trailing newline, the first appended key appears on the same line as the last existing key.

`fill` now writes through `POST /fill`, which uses the server's `TempEnvFile` RAII guard (zeros + deletes on error) instead of a raw client-side `std::fs::write`. Note this guard writes directly to the destination path (no temp-file-plus-rename), so it is still not atomic — a crash mid-write can leave the file truncated. A template key not resolvable in scope has its original line preserved unchanged rather than being blanked (fixed after an earlier version of this migration blanked unmatched keys, causing data loss on plain `.env` targets). The target is also now gated (see REST API's **Write-target gating**): an existing file not carrying the crypt-env marker causes `fill` to fail with the server's message on stderr unless `--force` is passed, in which case the prior contents are preserved in `<path>.bak`.

`--project`/`--env` flags are resolved independently (each field falls through flags → `crypt-env.json` → cwd-derived default on its own), not as an all-or-nothing pair — e.g. `--env staging` alone still picks up the project name from `crypt-env.json` if present.

`project inject` resolves environment by ID or by project+environment names (both case-insensitive). The environment's variables are matched via `environment_vars.item_id` (a real FK to the vault item), not by name search — the "matched by name" behavior only applies to legacy pre-migration rows still carrying a `literal` value with no `item_id`. Missing items appear as warnings but do not abort the injection. This subcommand (and `project delete-env`) still use `resolve_environment_id`/id-based lookups client-side and were intentionally left untouched by the project/environment scoping work — they were already project-scoped by construction.

`add` on a key that already exists in the resolved environment now updates the existing item **in place** (`POST /items` default `?on_conflict=update`) — the previous value is destroyed, matching the "Update all conflicting keys?" prompt's wording. Confirming (or `--force`) sends the default `update` mode. Declining no longer silently drops the key client-side — it is still sent, but with `?on_conflict=error`, so a genuine remaining collision is reported as `Conflict for '<key>' [KEY_EXISTS]: ...` rather than the CLI pretending nothing was asked for it. If the existing item is shared (global, linked in another environment, or multi-owned), the update is rejected with `SHARED_ITEM_CONFLICT` instead of silently rewriting a value another environment/project also sees; the CLI prints the key and reason, not a bare `HTTP 409`.

A crafted environment name (created via the GUI or with the static MCP token — CLI-driven `crypt-env.json`/cwd-derived names can't produce this) combined with `--project`/`--env` resolving to it could previously path-traverse `fill`'s/`project inject`'s `output_dir`-derived path outside the intended directory — fixed by issue #7 (see the "Environment/project name validation" note above): the name charset is now enforced on write, and `fsguard::resolve_within` independently contains any legacy row that predates the check.

`project list` shows all projects with nested environment details. Projects with no environments display "(none)" for environment and var count.

`doctor` no longer reports vault item count — `GET /health` stopped returning `item_count` (it leaked vault size to unauthenticated callers).

`cmd`/`exec` resolve a command by name against `GET /commands`, which now defaults to unioning in unlinked global commands (issue #13). When a linked command and a global command share the same name, the linked one wins and a one-line warning naming the shadowed global's id is printed to stderr — `crypt-env cmd`/`crypt-env exec` do not take `--scope-globals` themselves (they always resolve with the default union so a global command remains runnable from any project).

---

## TUI

Command: `crypt-env tui [--project NAME] [--env NAME]`

Scope (which project/environment's items are listed) is resolved the same way as every scoped CLI command — see `commands/scope.rs::resolve` in the CLI section above: `--project`/`--env` flags, then `crypt-env.json`, then the cwd folder name + the project's default environment. Resolution happens once, right after authentication succeeds (either from a cached token at startup or right after Unlock), since it may issue authenticated requests (`GET`/`POST /projects`). The active `project / environment` is shown in the top bar next to the item count.

Screens: Unlock (master password entry), Main (item list, scoped to the resolved project/environment), Detail (item metadata + controls), Help (keybinding reference), Confirm (destructive operation confirmation).

| Key | Screen | Action |
|-----|--------|--------|
| (type) | Unlock | Enter master password |
| Enter | Unlock | Submit password, transition to Main |
| ↑ / k | Main | Move selection up |
| ↓ / j | Main | Move selection down |
| / | Main | Enter fuzzy search mode |
| Esc | Main (search) | Exit search mode, clear filter |
| Enter | Main | Open Detail view for selected item |
| r | Main | Refresh item list from vault |
| ? | Main | Open Help screen |
| q | Main | Quit |
| v | Detail | Reveal/hide secret value |
| c | Detail | Copy secret value to clipboard |
| d | Detail | Show Confirm screen for delete |
| Esc / q | Detail | Return to Main |
| y / Enter | Confirm | Confirm destructive action |
| n / Esc | Confirm | Cancel |
| Esc / q | Help | Return to previous screen |
| Ctrl+C | Any | Quit immediately |

### Notes

TUI installs a panic hook (`std::panic::set_hook`) that disables raw mode and leaves the alternate screen before delegating to the default hook, so a mid-render panic restores the terminal rather than leaving it unusable.

Copy-to-clipboard (`c`) relies on `tauri-plugin-clipboard-manager`, a GUI plugin designed for Tauri's webview context — clipboard integration in a standalone TUI binary is uncertain and may silently fail or panic.

Reveal (`v`) calls GET /items/:id/reveal on the REST API for every toggle, generating server-side stderr logs — repeated toggling produces spam without debounce or client-side caching.

Fuzzy search operates on the in-memory item list loaded at Main screen entry — no re-fetch on search, so changes made elsewhere (API, CLI) are not reflected until `r` is pressed.

TUI has no auto-lock timeout despite the setting existing in vault config — the vault remains unlocked indefinitely if the user leaves the TUI open, bypassing the `auto_lock_timeout` setting entirely.

Scope resolution (`--project`/`--env` → `crypt-env.json` → cwd fallback) runs once per session and is memoized in `App.scope` — switching project/environment requires restarting the TUI with different flags or a different `crypt-env.json`, there is no in-app scope switcher.

If scope resolution fails after a cached token is found at startup (e.g. the vault was locked server-side, or the resolved project/environment no longer exists), the TUI falls back to the Unlock screen rather than showing a broken or partial item list.

Detail view includes `detail_scroll` field in App state but scroll rendering is not confirmed functional from the source code — long secrets may be silently clipped without visual indication.

## MCP

Tool namespace: `crypt-env` (invoked as `crypt_env_*`)

Protocol: JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio (protocol version 2024-11-05)

Authentication: Automatic — MCP server reads the REST API session token from disk on startup and reuses it for all tool invocations.

| Tool | Required | Optional | Description |
|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `crypt_env_list_items` | `environment_id` or (`project`+`environment`) | `type`, `category`, `include_global` | List item metadata (no values), scoped to a project+environment (required — the underlying `GET /items` now enforces it). `include_global` (`true`\|`false`\|`only`, default `true`) also lists reusable global secrets not yet linked into this environment — these appear with `linked: false` and will NOT be written by generate/inject/fill until linked. Filter by type or category on top |
| `crypt_env_get_item` | `id` | — | Get single item metadata (no value). Unscoped — `GET /items/:id` was not changed by this migration, reachable by id regardless of project |
| `crypt_env_search_items` | `query`, `environment_id` or (`project`+`environment`) | `include_global` | Search items by name within scope. Same `include_global` contract as `crypt_env_list_items`. Returns metadata only |
| `crypt_env_add_item` | `type`, `name`, `environment_id` or (`project`+`environment`) | `value`, `category`, `notes`, `url`, `username`, `key`, `on_conflict` | Add item to vault, owned by the resolved project and linked into the resolved environment under `key` (defaults to `name`). If `key` already exists in the target environment, the existing item is updated in place (`on_conflict` default `update`) — its previous value is destroyed. If that item is shared with other environments/projects (or is global), the call fails with `SHARED_ITEM_CONFLICT` instead of silently changing it elsewhere; retry with `on_conflict: "replace"` to create a new item and repoint just this link, or use `crypt_env_update_item` to change the shared value everywhere. `on_conflict: "error"` fails on any existing key. Value passes through MCP → REST in plaintext |
| `crypt_env_update_item` | `id` | `name`, `value`, `url`, `username`, `password`, `title`, `description`, `notes`, `content`, `command`, `shell`, `categories` | Update item. Omitted fields keep existing values server-side. Unscoped — `PUT /items/:id` was not changed by this migration |
| `crypt_env_delete_item` | `id` | — | Permanently delete item. Unscoped — `DELETE /items/:id` was not changed by this migration |
| `crypt_env_generate_env` | `keys`, `environment_id` or (`project`+`environment`) | — | Write .env file to temp dir with real values for given key names, looked up by item name within scope (see Notes for the name-vs-key mismatch vs `crypt_env_fill_env`). Returns path + count. Values never in response. Cleans up previous temp file on next call |
| `crypt_env_inject_env` | `key`, `environment_id` or (`project`+`environment`) | — | Inject one secret as env var into the MCP process via `std::env::set_var`. Does not return value |
| `crypt_env_fill_env` | `template` | `output_path`, `output_dir`, `overwrite`, `environment_id` or (`project`+`environment`) | Fill a template with vault secrets from the resolved environment, matched by `environment_vars.key`. `output_path` given: writes there. No `output_path` but `output_dir`: writes `{output_dir}/.env.<environment-name>`. Neither: **filled content returned inline in the tool response** — a value-exposure path that didn't exist when `output_path` was required. Refuses to overwrite a file it didn't create unless `overwrite: true` — see Notes |
| `crypt_env_import_env_file` | `path`, `environment_id` or (`project`+`environment`) | `category`, `overwrite` | Read .env file from disk, parse KEY=value pairs, import each as a vault item owned by the resolved project and linked into the resolved environment. Existing item found by name: `overwrite:true` updates it in place (`PUT`, destroying its previous value), `overwrite:false` (default) skips it. Not found by name but the environment key still collides (renamed item, or a race): the create call maps `overwrite:true` → `on_conflict=update` and `overwrite:false` → `on_conflict=error`, and a resulting `409` is folded into the same `skipped_existing` report bucket rather than `errors` — this is what stops bulk import from mass-producing orphans (issue #9). Values never in MCP response |
| `crypt_env_update_settings` | — | `auto_lock_timeout`, `hotkey` | Update vault settings |
| `crypt_env_doctor` | — | — | Health check: app status, lock state, token config. No longer reports item count — `GET /health` stopped returning `item_count` |
| `crypt_env_list_commands` | `environment_id` or (`project`+`environment`) | — | List saved commands with placeholders, scoped to a project+environment |
| `crypt_env_run_command` | `name`, `environment_id` or (`project`+`environment`) | `params` | Resolve {{VAR}} placeholders and execute command via shell. Command lookup is scoped; the detail fetch itself is unscoped. Returns stdout/stderr (truncated 2000 chars) and exit code. Resolved command never returned |
| `crypt_env_share_listen` | `items`, `environment_id` or (`project`+`environment`) | — | Start LAN share session. `items` must already be linked into the resolved environment or the call fails. Returns pairing_code |
| `crypt_env_share_connect` | `pairing_code`, `environment_id` or (`project`+`environment`) | — | Connect as receiver. Received items get owned by the resolved project and linked into the resolved environment (skipping any that collide with an existing key — see Notes). Returns fingerprint |
| `crypt_env_share_confirm` | `confirmed` | — | Confirm/reject fingerprint (boolean) |
| `crypt_env_share_cancel` | — | — | Cancel active share session |
| `crypt_env_share_status` | — | — | Get session state, fingerprint, direction, skipped_keys |
| `crypt_env_share_export` | `items`, `output_path` | — | Export as .vault package. Passphrase shown in response once. Unscoped (operates on item IDs directly) |
| `crypt_env_share_import` | `path`, `passphrase`, `environment_id` or (`project`+`environment`) | — | Import from .vault package. Imported items are owned by the resolved project and linked into the resolved environment, same collision-skip behavior as `crypt_env_share_connect` |
| `crypt_env_list_categories` | — | — | List categories |
| `crypt_env_create_category` | `name`, `color` | `description` | Create category |
| `crypt_env_update_category` | `id` | `name`, `color`, `description` | Update category. Empty string description clears it |
| `crypt_env_delete_category` | `id` | — | Delete category |
| `crypt_env_list_projects` | — | — | List all projects with their typed environments (name, template, paths, var count) |
| `crypt_env_inject_environment` | — | `environment_id` or `project`+`environment`, `output_path`, `output_dir`, `overwrite` | Inject an environment's variables into its configured .env path(s), plus `output_path`/`output_dir` if given (appended to, not replacing, configured paths). Identify by `environment_id` or project+environment names. Refuses to overwrite an `output_path`/`output_dir` target it didn't create unless `overwrite: true` — see Notes |
| `crypt_env_generate_example_env` | — | `environment_id` or `project`+`environment`, `output_path`, `output_dir`, `overwrite` | Generate a placeholder-only (`KEY=`, no values) env file/content for an environment — safe to commit. Never reads or decrypts item values. Same `overwrite` gating as the two tools above |
| `crypt_env_list_environments_by_name` | — | — | List all environments across all projects, grouped by their real environment name (production, local, test, etc.) |
| `crypt_env_inject_env_by_name` | `project_path`, `environment` | `output_path` (unused, kept for compatibility) | Inject environment variables for a project directory and environment name. Matches by real environment name; if no matching environment is found, returns an error with next steps — the previous item-naming-convention fallback was removed (see Notes) |
| `crypt_env_relay_send` | `item_ids` | — | Send via internet relay. Returns code + passphrase (show immediately, only once) |
| `crypt_env_relay_receive` | `code`, `passphrase`, `environment_id` or (`project`+`environment`) | — | Receive via internet relay. Imported items are owned by the resolved project and linked into the resolved environment, same collision-skip behavior as `crypt_env_share_connect` |
| `crypt_env_list_mcp_servers` | — | `scope` | List registered MCP servers from Claude config. Scope: global/project/all. Env values never returned |
| `crypt_env_add_mcp_server` | `name`, `command` | `args`, `env`, `scope` | Add MCP server to Claude config. `env` stores KEY: "" placeholders — never real values |
| `crypt_env_update_mcp_server` | `name` | `command`, `args`, `env`, `scope` | Merge-update existing MCP server entry |
| `crypt_env_delete_mcp_server` | `name` | `scope` | Remove MCP server entry from Claude config |

### Notes

`crypt_env_add_item` with `value` parameter passes the secret plaintext through the LLM's tool call context — this is the only tool that breaks the "values never visible to LLM" design principle, and any agent/LLM host logging tool calls will capture the raw secret value permanently.

`crypt_env_generate_env` writes to `std::env::temp_dir()` with random filename but does NOT enforce restrictive permissions (unlike the API's TempEnvFile with 0o600) — on multi-user systems the temp .env is world-readable until cleanup or next call.

`crypt_env_generate_env`/`crypt_env_inject_env` look up keys by vault **item name** (`GET /items?search=`); `crypt_env_fill_env` matches by `environment_vars.key`. When an item's linked key differs from its name (supported since `POST /items` gained the `key` field), these two families disagree on which variables they can find for the same environment.

`crypt_env_inject_environment`'s new `output_path`/`output_dir` parameters let a single call write an environment's full decrypted variable set to any filesystem path, appended to (not replacing) the environment's GUI-configured paths — previously this tool could only write to paths a human had configured through the app. A prompt-injected or confused agent can use this for a one-shot full-environment secret dump; there is no per-key selection or additional confirmation gate on this path beyond normal tool-call approval.

`crypt_env_inject_env` uses `std::env::set_var` which is marked `unsafe` in Rust with `#[allow(unused_unsafe)]` — calling set_var from a multi-threaded context is undefined behavior if any thread reads env vars concurrently; the MCP server's single-threaded main loop mitigates this in practice.

`crypt_env_run_command` substitutes {{VAR}} placeholders into shell commands without sanitization — if params contain shell metacharacters or a vault item's command template is user-controlled, this is a command injection vector.

`crypt_env_inject_environment` resolves environment by `environment_id` or by project+environment names (both case-insensitive). The environment's configured paths (plus `output_path`/`output_dir` if given) are used to write .env files; variables are matched via `environment_vars.item_id` (a real FK), not by name search. Returns paths written and keys injected.

**Scope-parameter naming is now consistent across every environment-scoped tool** (issue #10): `crypt_env_inject_environment` and `crypt_env_generate_example_env` used to be the only tools naming the scope parameter `id` instead of `environment_id`, which let an LLM that inferred the name from every other tool's schema pass a key that was silently ignored — in the worst case resolving a *different* environment by name with no error. Both schemas now advertise `environment_id` with the same wording used everywhere else. The bare `id` key is still accepted as an unadvertised, deprecated alias for the 1.0.x line only (removed in 1.1.0): calls using it still succeed, but the response text appends `note: parameter 'id' is deprecated on this tool; use 'environment_id' instead.` The invariant that no environment-scoped tool declares a bare `id` is enforced by tests in `src-tauri/src/bin/crypt-env-mcp.rs` (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`, run via `cargo test --bin crypt-env-mcp`).

`crypt_env_fill_env`, `crypt_env_inject_environment` and `crypt_env_generate_example_env` all gate their `output_path`/`output_dir` write target the same way as the REST API (see REST API's **Write-target gating**): an existing file not carrying the crypt-env marker gets a `409` from the underlying endpoint, surfaced by the tool as `target_exists: <server message>. Ask the user before retrying with overwrite=true.` — advisory only, since an agent can ignore the instruction and retry anyway; the actual control is that the prior contents are preserved in `<path>.bak` the moment `overwrite: true` is passed. `crypt_env_inject_environment`'s owner-configured `environment.paths[]` are never gated this way and don't need `overwrite` to write through them.

`crypt_env_list_environments_by_name` lists all environments grouped by their real environment name field, providing a different view than `crypt_env_list_projects` (which groups by project).

`crypt_env_inject_env_by_name` resolves by project directory + environment name. If a real environment is found, its paths are used. If not found, the tool now returns an error with next steps (pass an explicit `environment_id`, or `project`+`environment`) — the previous fallback to item-naming-convention matching (name prefix, category) was removed, since it relied on the now-scope-required `/items`/`/fill` endpoints in a way that could no longer work safely. `output_path` is accepted for backward compatibility but is currently unused.

Fixed (issue #13): `crypt_env_list_items` and `crypt_env_search_items` now default to `include_global=true`, unioning in reusable global items (`isGlobal: true`) that are not yet linked into the queried environment — each result carries `isGlobal` and `linked` so the agent can tell "exists and reusable" apart from "will actually be written". Pass `include_global=false` to see exactly the linked set, or `only` to see just the globals. The remaining gap is unchanged: `crypt_env_generate_env` and `crypt_env_inject_env` still resolve strictly by linkage (matching `/fill`'s/`/inject`'s materialization-only contract) — a global secret discovered via `crypt_env_list_items` still requires an explicit link into the environment (e.g. via `crypt_env_add_item`) before either of those tools can write it.

Whole-project relay sharing (`POST /projects/:id/relay/send` / `/projects/relay/receive`) intentionally has **no MCP tool** — sending an entire project's decrypted secrets to a third-party relay from a single agent-callable tool, with no way for the agent to meaningfully obtain the sender's confirmation, is a materially different trust decision than the existing per-item `crypt_env_relay_send`/`_receive`. If ever wanted, it needs its own consent design as a separate change.

MCP server is single-threaded with a blocking I/O loop (`stdin.lock().lines()`) — a slow or stalled request blocks all subsequent MCP tool calls and the LLM host may time out other concurrent requests.

`TEMP_FILES` cleanup in `crypt_env_generate_env` is best-effort (called at start of next call) — if the MCP process exits before another call, temp .env files are abandoned on disk.

MCP config management tools (`crypt_env_add/update/delete_mcp_server`) do not validate the `command` field for path traversal or injection — a crafted command string could write an adversarial entry to the Claude config files.
