; GetTruePathLenImpl — measures the TRUE length of HKCU\Environment\Path by
; querying the registry API directly (RegQueryValueExW with a NULL buffer,
; the documented Win32 way to ask "how big is this value?" without reading
; it). This is the fix for a critical bug: the previous guard inferred
; truncation from StrLen of whatever ReadRegStr returned — but ReadRegStr
; itself silently truncates any value longer than NSIS_MAX_STRLEN with no
; error signal, so a genuinely huge PATH could come back already truncated
; to something UNDER the guard's threshold, pass the check as "safe", and
; then get written back verbatim — permanently destroying everything past
; the truncation point. This measures the real on-disk size first, before
; any bounded NSIS string variable is ever involved, so the decision to
; proceed is based on ground truth, not on a value that may already be
; mangled.
;
; Output: $8 = true length in UTF-16 characters (rounded up by 1 — a safe
;              overestimate, never an underestimate). 0 if the value is
;              absent.
;         $9 = 1 if the length is known-good. 0 if the registry query
;              itself failed for any reason — callers MUST treat 0 as
;              "unknown, refuse to touch PATH", never as "assume safe".
